					Liability for Content
				</h2>
				<p>
					As a service provider, we are responsible for our own
					content on these pages in accordance with general law (§ 7
					Para.1 TMG). However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are
					not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party

					illegal activity.

				<p class="mt-4">
					Obligations to remove or block the use of information under
					general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Liability for Links</h2>
				<p>
					Our website contains links to external third-party websites,

					cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The
					respective provider or operator of the linked pages is
					always responsible for their content.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4">
					The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations
					at the time of linking. Illegal content was not apparent at
					the time of linking. However, continuous content monitoring
					of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
					evidence of a violation. Upon becoming aware of rights
					violations, we will remove such links immediately.
